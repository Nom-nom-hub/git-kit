# Welcome to Git-Kit

**Git-Kit** is your GitHub Boss. It automates the "Git-Kit Methodology" for managing software projects with AI Agents.

## Overview
Git-Kit provides:
1.  **Strict Methodology**: Templates for PRs, Releases, and Designs.
2.  **CLI Tool**: `git-kit` to automate the heavy lifting.
3.  **Agent Integration**: Scripts and prompts to make AI a first-class citizen in your repo.

## Getting Started
See [Quickstart](quickstart.md) to initialize your first project.

## Commands
*   `git-kit init`: Setup a repo.
*   `git-kit pr`: Plan a feature.
*   `git-kit release`: Ship software.
*   `git-kit status`: See where you are.

## Architecture
Git-Kit is built on Python (CLI) and Shell (Agent Scripts), driven by Markdown configuration files.
